/* 
 * PROBLEM SOLVED: Remove Archie theme's Markdown-style heading prefixes
 * 
 * The Archie theme intentionally adds "##", "###", etc. before headings via CSS
 * to show the Markdown syntax visually. This was causing confusion as it looked
 * like the Markdown wasn't being processed correctly.
 * 
 * Original theme CSS:
 * h2::before { content: '## '; }
 * h3::before { content: '### '; }
 * 
 * Our solution: Override with empty content using !important for specificity
