# Documentation Workflow Guide

## For Every Code Change Session

### 1. Before Starting
- [ ] Review current README.md to understand existing documentation
- [ ] Check if new features need documentation updates

### 2. During Development  
- [ ] Add inline comments explaining complex logic
- [ ] Document any new files or significant changes
- [ ] Note any breaking changes or new requirements

### 3. After Completing Changes
- [ ] Update README.md with new features/changes
- [ ] Add or update code comments in all modified files
- [ ] Document any new dependencies or setup requirements
- [ ] Test that documentation is accurate and complete

## Documentation Standards

### Code Comments Should Include:
- **Purpose**: What does this code do?

### README.md Should Cover:
- Project overview and purpose
