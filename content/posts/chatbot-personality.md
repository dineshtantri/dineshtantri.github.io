title: "Infusing Personality In Chatbots"

Over the past week, I’ve been experimenting with something fascinating: personality infusion for chatbots.

💡 Inspired by a research paper on personality engineering, I tried building a middleware layer that dynamically rewrites LLM responses based on traits (vibrancy, conscientiousness, civility, etc.), instead of fine-tuning the model itself.

I set this up on [LibreChat](https://www.librechat.ai/) (an open-source ChatGPT-like platform), with the help of Claude Code in VS Code.

What stood out: Claude’s init command instantly documented the repo structure and backend/frontend flow. ASCII diagrams made understanding message flow architecture a breeze. Writing requirements in markdown + iterating with AI felt like magic.

🚀 The outcome: Users get have an option to pick pre-defined AI personalities (e.g., Encouraging Mentor), which dynamically shape responses.

Key learning: AI coding agents aren’t just for writing code - they’re mentors for understanding complex repos, system design, and data structures. For students and self-learners, this is a powerful way to move beyond rote LeetCode and learn from real-world codebases with an AI partner by your side. You should start using Gemini CLI, Claude Code etc.
