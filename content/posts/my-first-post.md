# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using Hugo with the **Archie** theme.

## What is Archie?

Archie is a minimal and clean Hugo theme that provides:

- Clean, minimalist design
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Responsive layout
- Syntax highlighting
- Simple navigation

## Code Example

Here's some sample code:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("Hugo");
```

Thanks for visiting my blog!
