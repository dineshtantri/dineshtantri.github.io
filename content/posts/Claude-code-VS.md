Claude code in VS Code is my new go-to learning tool. I wanted to learn about Responsible AI and started a conversation. We ended up with a really good learning plan with relevant data sets (including one synthetic data set) and of course the sandbox to test and practice. Fantastic to do short hands-on learning sprints or deep dives. The learning and explanatory outcome styles are fantastic!
