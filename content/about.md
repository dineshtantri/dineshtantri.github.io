    <p>I have worked with TCS, ThoughtWorks, and Microsoft in techno-functional and product management roles, building experience at the intersection of technology and business. Now a freelancer and founder of Digithos, I explore diverse interests ranging from learning with AI to poetry, anti-work philosophy, and long reflective walks.</p>
